SimpleMessages - bans, kicks and records.
====================================

SimpleMessages is a plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) that allows adminstrators to define commands which will return the contents of a text file. This could be used to provide a custom help command or any other information that you want your players to know.

## Features

- Simple and easy to configure.
- All files are cached on startup to eliminate disk IO.
- Supports colour codes in the text files.
- Supports long line wrapping if necessary.
- Paginates files if output is too long to display on the screen at once.

## Installation

### Ensure you are using the latest recommended build.

Before installing, you need to make sure you are running at least the latest [recommended build](http://repo.bukkit.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=releases&g=org.bukkit&a=craftbukkit&v=RELEASE) for Bukkit. Support is only given for problems when using a recommended build. This does not mean that the plugin will not work on other versions of Bukkit, the likelihood is it will, but it is not supported.

### Getting SimpleMessages

The best way to install SimpleMessages is to use the [symbolic link](http://repository.james.richardson.name/symbolic/SimpleMessages.jar) to the latest version. This link always points to the latest version of SimpleMessages, so is safe to use in scripts or update plugins. Additionally you can to use the [RSS feed](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/SimpleMessages/files.rss) provided by BukkitDev as this also includes a version changelog.
    
Alternatively [older versions](http://repository.james.richardson.name/releases/name/richardson/james/bukkit/simple-messages/) are available as well, however they are not supported. If you are forced to use an older version for whatever reason, please let me know why by [opening a issue](https://github.com/grandwazir/SimpleMessages/issues/new) on GitHub.

All documentation for SimpleMessages is available on the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/grandwazir/SimpleMessages/wiki), including [example usage](https://github.com/grandwazir/SimpleMessages/wiki/Instructions) and details on [how to configure](https://github.com/grandwazir/SimpleMessages/wiki/Permissions) the plugin.
